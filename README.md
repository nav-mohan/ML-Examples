Collection of Jupyter notebooks to study the theory and implementation of some methods at the intersection of machine learning and computational-geometry. 
* Ball-Trees and KD-Trees for spatial-indexing
* Bowyer-Watson algorithm for delaunay triangulation
* Iterative methods (CG,SSOR) for solving DEQs
* Polynomial normals estimation and surface model-fitting (Jets)
* Moving least-squares (1D,2D) for surface model-fitting
* Meshless surface model-fitting (uses PCA) pipeline
* Radial Basis Function surface model-fitting
* Collision-Detection using Separating Axis Thereom in 3D
